nside your for loop
How many lines you are reading ?
Only one line .... (line 26)
and How many tokens you are reading ?
Three times at least (lines 27,28,30)
This means every line should contain 3 tokens which is NOT true

-You are missing reading a new line for every iteration inside of x loop

-You are missing clearing arraylists for every test case
- Your output format is NOT the same as the required format

and I am not considering your algorithm correctness
